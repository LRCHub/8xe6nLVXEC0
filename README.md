[00:09.67] I wasn't taught how to get a job
[00:12.17] But I can remember dissecting a frog
[00:14.83] I wasn't taught how to pay tax
[00:17.20] But I know loads about Shakespeare's classics
[00:39.70] 
[00:19.93] I was never taught how to vote
[00:21.50] They devoted that time to defining isotopes
[00:24.72] I wasn't taught how to look after my health
[00:26.63] But mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
[00:49.63] 
[00:30.34] Never spent a lesson on current events
[00:32.55] Instead I studied The Old American West
[00:35.11] I was never taught what laws there are
[00:37.67] I was never taught what laws there are
[00:56.67] 
[00:39.98] Let me repeat, I was not taught the laws for the country I live in
[00:42.96] But I know how Henry the VIII killed his women
[00:45.09] Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived
[00:47.47] Glad that's in my head instead of financial advice
[01:12.47] 
[00:49.95] I was shown the wavelengths of different hues of light
[00:52.78] But I was never taught my human rights
[00:54.94] Apparently, there's 30, do you know them? I don't
[00:57.62] Why the hell can't we both recite them by rote?
[01:21.12] 
[00:59.92] I know igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks
[01:02.78] Yet I don't know squat about trading stocks
[01:05.07] Or how money works at all, where does it come from?
[01:07.74] How does the thing that motivates the world function?
[01:34.24] 
[01:10.66] Not taught how to budget and disburse my earnings
[01:12.95] I was too busy there rehearsing cursive
[01:15.14] Didn't learn how much it costs to raise a kid or what an affidavit is
[01:18.20] But I spent days on what the quadratic equation is
[01:43.20] 
[01:20.36] Negative b, plus or minus, the square root of b squared
[01:23.61] Minus 4ac, over 2a
[01:25.17] That's insane, that's absolutely insane
[01:27.93] They made me learn that over basic first aid
[01:49.93] 
[01:30.38] Or how to recognise the most deadly mental disorders
[01:32.91] Or diseases with preventable causes
[01:34.94] Or how to buy a house with a mortgage
[01:36.92] If I could afford it
[01:46.92] 
[01:38.01] 'Cause abstract maths was deemed more important
[01:40.66] Than advice that would literally save thousands of lives
[01:45.06] But it's cool, 'cause now I could tell you if the number
[01:47.15] Of unnecessary deaths caused by that choice was prime
[02:13.65] 
[01:50.41] Never taught present day practical medicines
[01:52.97] But I was told what the ancient hippocratic method is
[01:56.12] "I've got a headache, the pain is ceaseless, what should I take?"
[01:58.79] Umm, maybe try some leeches?
[02:12.79] 
[02:00.83] "Could we discuss domestic abuse and get the facts
[02:03.22] Or how to help my depressed friend with their mental state?"
[02:05.77] Ummm, no, but learn mental maths
[02:08.39] Because "You won't have a calculator with you, every day!"
[02:37.39] 
[02:10.40] They say it's not the kids, the parents are the problem
[02:13.51] Then if you taught the kids to parent, that's the problem solved then
[02:16.42] All this advice about using a condom
[02:18.62] But none for when you actually have a kid, when you want one
[02:48.62] 
[02:21.20] I'm only fluent in this language, for serious?
[02:23.69] The rest of the world speaks two, do you think I'm an idiot?
[02:26.16] They chose the solar over the political system
[02:28.67] So, like a typical citizen, now, I don't know what I'm voting on
[03:00.67] 
[02:31.34] Which policies exist, or how to make them change
[02:33.41] Mais oui, je parle un peu de française
[02:36.17] So at 18, I was expected to elect a representative
[02:38.71] For a system I had never, ever, ever been presented with
[03:06.71] 
[02:41.82] But I won't take it
[02:43.54] I'll tell everyone my childhood was wasted
[02:45.94] I'll share it everywhere how I was "educated"
[02:48.61] And insist these pointless things
[02:50.65] Don't stay in school
